1. Ensure you have some Keywords and Ideas before creating a Schedule. The Schedule feature will use content ideas first and then fallback to Keywords to generate articles.
2. Next, navigate to Schedule on the dashboard.
3. Click 'Create Schedule' and fill out your desired schedule.
4. Pick the Template your Schedule should use. This will determine how the article will be generated - with images, brand tone etc.
