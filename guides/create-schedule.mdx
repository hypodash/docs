Schedules allow you to create repeating intervals of content generation with templates.

<Info>
  Your OpenAI API key is required to use this feature.
</Info>

1. Ensure you have some `Keywords` and `Ideas` before creating a `Schedule`. The `Schedule` feature will use content ideas first and then fallback to `Keywords` to generate articles.
2. Next, navigate to [Schedule](https://hypodash.com/schedules) on the dashboard.
3. Click `Create Schedule` and fill out your desired release cadence.
4. Pick the `Template` your `Schedule `should use. This will determine how the `Article` will be generated - with images, brand tone etc.
5. Make sure to setup your integration via `WordPress`,`Zapier` or `Webhook` . You can learn more [here](https://docs.hypodash.com/guides/create-article).
