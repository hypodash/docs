## Setup your OpenAi API key

1. Navigate to [App Settings](https://hypodash.com/settings/app).
2. If you dont already have an OpenAi key, please [sign up](https://auth.openai.com/create-account) and create one [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
3. If you plan on generating images, please ensure your [organization is verified](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general) under General on the OpenAi dashboard. Failure to verify will result in errors during article creation.
4. Ensure you either top up credits in the billing page or add your credit/debit card to avoid errors when generating content.
5. Paste your key into the OpenAi Key field and save.

<Info>
  **Using your OpenAi key with Hypodash will consume tokens. You will be billed seperately by OpenAi outside your Hypodash plan.**
