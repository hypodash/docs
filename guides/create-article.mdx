Articles can be generated manually or via the Schedule feature.

## Setup your OpenAi API key

1. Navigate to [App Settings](https://hypodash.com/settings/app).
2. If you dont already have an OpenAi key, please [sign up](https://auth.openai.com/create-account) and create one [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
3. If you plan on generating images, please ensure your [organization is verified](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general) under General on the OpenAi dashboard. Failure to verify will result in errors during article creation.
4. Ensure you either top up credits in the billing page or add your credit/debit card to avoid errors when generating content.
5. Paste your key into the OpenAi Key field and save.

<Info>
  **Using your OpenAi key with Hypodash will consume tokens. You will be billed seperately by OpenAi outside your Hypodash plan.**
</Info>

## Create a template

Templates make it easy to define modifiers and options for each generation and reuse them at a later date or with the Schedule feature.

1. Navigate to the `Template` page and configure.
2. Setting the template to default will allow you to automatically use this template when creating new articles.
3. If you decide to add image generations, please ensure your **OpenAi organization is verified**, otherwise it will fail.
4. For YouTube integration, please add your YouTube API key under [App Settings](https://hypodash.com/settings/app) to inject relevant videos into the article sections.

<Warning>
  If you plan on generating images, please ensure your [organization is verified](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general) under General on the OpenAi dashboard. Failure to verify will result in errors during article creation.
</Warning>

## How to create an article

1. Navigate to the `Article` page on the dashboard.
2. Click `Create Article` and fill out the fields.
3. Ensure you have the correct template chosen on the recently created one above - otherwise we will use our basic default template.
4. Once ready, click `Generate` and wait for the task to complete.
5. For `web research`, `image generations` and `video lookup`, this can be upwards of a few minutes to complete.

## Publishing articles

Once an article is completed, you have a few options to publish.

### Manual

1. Click into your new article and click the `Download` button.
2. You will be presented with `Markdown`, `HTML` or `Plain Text` download options.
3. If you generated images, you can also download `media files` here too.

   <Info>
     Media files are deleted after 48 hours, please ensure you download media files before they expire.
   </Info>
4. Image paths within the body of the article will be relative to the file name - you can easily append your new upload path afterwards.
