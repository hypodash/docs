Templates are a great way to control and customize how articles are generated. Choose to include, images, youtube videos, model choice and more.

1. Navigate to [Templates](https://hypodash.com/templates) and click `Create template` .
2. Configure various options to determine how the article should be generated.
3. Click `Default template` to use this template by default when creating a new article.
4. `Realtime lookup` allows the model to search realtime results. It will consume more tokens, but allows for much better up-to-date information for the article.
5. `Include brand context` will allow you to write the article in your tone and style. Make sure to add your `Website URL` and `Example Article URl` under [App Settings](https://hypodash.com/settings/app).
6. Use the `Type` dropdown to choose either `AI Generated` images (which consumes credits) or `Unsplash` to pick random images to include in your article based on each section header.
7. `YouTube` will allow you (if you have the API Key set under [App Settings](https://hypodash.com/settings/app)), to add inline YouTube embeds relating to each article section automatically.
