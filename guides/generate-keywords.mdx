Use AI to find relevant keywords for your company or product.

1. Navigate to [Keywords](https://hypodash.com/keywords) and enter a keyword relating to your topic or keyword.
1. Click the `plus icon` and wait for 10 new keywords to be created.
1. If you spot an keyword you like, click the `Generate idea` button and it'll prefill the `Ideas create` form.

`Keywords` are also used for the [Schedule](https://docs.hypodash.com/guides/create-schedule) feature and will fall back to `Keyword` records if there are no `Ideas`.

The `Used 2 times` message is used for reference in the `Schedule` to pick keywords it's maybe not used yet in `Article` generation.
